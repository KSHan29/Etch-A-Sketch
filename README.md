Hover mouse over the respective cells to colour them!

Use the controls on the left to change the colouring function. Rainbow generates random colour while darken shades the cell darker. Eraser changes the colour back to the background colour.

Default mode is `Colour`. `Rainbow` mode, `Darken` mode and `Eraser` mode can be toggled on and off by clicking on the buttons.
